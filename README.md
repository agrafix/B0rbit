B0rbit
======

# Intro

This is a small bot for the browsergame [DarkOrbit](http://darkorbit.de) which I hacked together back in 2011. It does not work anymore, but I thought it would be nice to share it for people to lern about browsergame bot coding. It also provided a small UI and you could see your ship, boxes and enemies flying around.

# Setup/Usage

You my either run the bot using 

```python3 B0rbit.py```

or you can build a Windows-Executable using

```compile.bat```
